The best chess prediction

## Context
The goal of the project is to build a model able to generate FEN description based on a schematic image of a chess board.

## Content
100000 images of a randomly generated chess positions of 5-15 pieces (2 kings and 3-13 pawns/pieces)
Images were generated using 28 styles of chess boards and 32 styles of chess pieces totaling 896 board/piece style combinations.

Images were generated using this custom-build tool

All images are 400 by 400 pixels.

Training set: 80000 images
Test set: 20000 images
Pieces were generated with the following probability distribution:

30% for Pawn
20% for Bishop
20% for Knight
20% for Rook
10% for Queen
2 Kings are guaranteed to be on the board.

Labels are in a filename in Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation format, but with dashes instead of slashes.

## Acknowledgements
Chess.com for providing images of pieces and boards.

## Note
Some positions may be illegal such as both kings are under check.

## Inspiration
2020 has definitely been the year of chess. Between 2020 locking everyone indoors, and Netflix's Queen Gambit raking in 62 millino viewers, everyone is either talking about chess, or watching others play chess.
